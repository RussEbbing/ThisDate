Although I like the output... Not all things so clear with DoxFx.

Build will build the contents of the _site folder.

However, the template is not applide by build. Must issue this command. Folders need to be fully qualified.
docfx C:\BitBucket\ThisDate\Documentation\docfx.json -t C:\BitBucket\ThisDate\Documentation\templates\site\default
