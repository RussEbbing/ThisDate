DocFx

https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/

Although I like the output... Not all things so clear with DoxFx.

Build will build the contents of the _site folder.
However, the template is not applide by build. Must issue this command. Folders need to be fully qualified.


To build with the template:
1) Set Documents => as startup project
2) Package Manager Console
3) docfx C:\GitHub\ThisDate\Documentation\docfx.json -t C:\GitHub\ThisDate\Documentation\templates\site\default
4) Copy the contents of _site to the /Docs folder, commit to github.
